# Kanoodle Extreme Solver - 3D

This has been a fun hobby project that I've contributed to off-and-on over the course of the last three years. What started as an obsessive curiosity to see if a backtracking algorithm could solve a complex 3D puzzle in a reasonable performance window quickly became a great proving grounds for learning and experimentation in advanced performance optimization strategies  and 3D scene rendering using three.js
